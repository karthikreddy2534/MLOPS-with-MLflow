from mlProject import logger
#here mlproject is the project folder name in src and logger is defind inside its file so we are able to import functionality it.

#here we are not calling src but directly calling mlproject as we mentioned it already in initfile.
#or we can mention like src.mlproject

logger.info("Welcome to our custom logging")
